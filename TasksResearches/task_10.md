## Path Traversal Attacks and Double Encoding:

### Path Traversal Attack

- Path traversal is about sneaking into files you shouldnâ€™t access.
- A path traversal attacks happens when someone or attacker is able to access files or directories that are not allowed to him to show as an example; the files and directories related to admins. Not all users are allowed to browse them.
- Simply the attacker can exceed the security limits set to gain access to files or information they have no access to see.

#### To Prevent It:
- Make sure the file paths users provide are checked carefully.
- Only allow access to files you know are safe and in the right place.

### Double Encoding

- Double encoding is about tricking systems that try to guard against tricky inputs.
- Double encoding is a technique used by attackers to trick website security systems. When a website tries to protect itself from dangerous inputs, it has a system to check for encoding.
Double encoding means the attacker encodes their input twice or more to bypass the filters that protect the site.


#### To Prevent It
- Make sure you decode inputs completely before checking them.
- Use built-in tools and libraries designed to handle encoding safely.

### But by using Laravel, it protects against both path Traversal and Double encoding attacks through robust validation techniques, access control tools, and secure handling of inputs.
