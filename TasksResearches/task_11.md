## Discover the risk of not making the root directory of laravel project public path.


### Introduction:

Laravel should always be served out of the root of the "web directory" configured for your web server. You should not attempt to serve a Laravel application out of a subdirectory of the "web directory". Attempting to do so could expose sensitive files present within your application.


## Risks of Incorrect Setup

1. **Security Risks:**\
    Exposing sensitive files that should not be publicly accessible, such as (`app`, `config`, `.env`, `database` ,etc.). this would lead that sensitive files being exposed, such as config. files containing environment variables or database credentials. 

2. **Broken Website Features:**\
    Missing images, CSS, and JavaScript files due to incorrect paths.\
   This could lead to directory traversal attacks, as hackers could access directories and files that shouldn't be exposed .  

3. **Performance Issues:**\
  Slower load times and inefficient handeling of resource requests and potential performance issues if these directories are not optimized for web access..


## How to Fix

1. after setting `public` as the web root; configure your web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) to serve files from the public directory. This isolates your applicationâ€™s core files and configuration from public access.

2. Ensure that permissions are correctly set on directories and files, with the web server having only the necessary access rights.

3. Utilize `.htaccess` files in Apache or equivalent configurations in Nginx to restrict access to non-public files and directories.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Laravel application runs smoothly and securely.
